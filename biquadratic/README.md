# Pythagoras numbers of orders in biquadratic fields
**At this point, this repository is in a preliminary stage.**

**The main parts of the code (which won't be changed much) are here and should be at this point fairly readable for anyone skilled in Python.**

**At the very latest by May 28 new version of documentation, unit tests, refurbished commented code and overall better description of usage will appear.**

## General Information
- This project contains the code in Python for computational parts of number theory article with the same name as the title by Jakub Krásenský, Martin Raška and Ester Sgallová.
- The article is available at [_arXiv_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08860).
- In a nutshell, for biquadratic field, the algorithms take all elements up to a given trace and find out their lengths (i.e. how many squares are needed for a representation by the sum of squares). This gives a good lower bound and estimation for Pythagoras number of the field.
