# Pythagoras numbers of orders in biquadratic fields -- documentation
<a name="line-4"></a>
## Description
For general information about the project see [README](README.md). Used algorithms are described in referenced article.
The goal is focused on finding Pythagoras number of the ring of integers in biquadratic fields.
Proving that all that all elements can be represented as a sum of at most _k_ squares is obviously a difficult task, since there are infinitely many elements. However one can get a lower bound by finding an element with big length (i.e. requires a lot of squares) and decent estimates of the Pythagoras number by looking at all elements up to a given trace. So these are the two main goals fo the following code.

##### Class structure

For working with biquadratic fields, we use classes `BiquadField{I/II_III/IVa/IVb}`, each representing one of the four different types of biquadratic fields (see article preliminaries). They all inherit from abstract class `BiquadField`, which implements most of the algorithms regarding sum of squares, while these non-abstract classes implement the type-of-field-specific functions such as trace, square of the integer, etc.

Integral elements are represented as quadruples `(a,b,c,d)` with _a,b,c,d_ rational integers and this quadruple correspond to the integral basis of the specific field (each of the fields of type BI, BII/III, BIVa, BIVb have differeny type of integral basis). We will work with the maximal order (for which we have implemented the 4 different derived classes), however, one can implement this kind of derived class for non-maximal order as well (or for quadratic fields), as long as integral elements are represented as quadruples and functions for trace, tuple of square, etc. are implemented.

##### Type of methods
For used algorithms see the mentioned article. The fastest methods generate step by step elements with length 1, 2, 3, etc. up to a given trace.

A slower alternative (which on the other hand requires less memory) is to look at elements of one fixed trace and generate them combining elements of smaller traces. This is less time efficient, but could perhaps provide additional insight and is usefull when high memory use is a problem. These methods are indicated by suffix _by_trace_.

##### Warning
Most of the functions are not written to be foolproof, so wherever user input is used, we require some restrictions.
E.g. when we talk about sum of _k_ squares, we mean _k > 0_. Therefore, e.g. if some function checks if an element is a sum of _k_ squares, we assume the argument _k_ to be positive. The same goes for trace in the most cases, since most of the functions regarding sums of squares are designed to work only with totally positive integers. All of these and other assumptions should be pretty intuitive and are written later in the documentation. You have been warned.


## Abstract class BiquadField

 As was mentioned, from this class are derived all the used classes _BiquadFieldI_, _BiquadFieldII_III_, _BiquadFieldIVa_, _BiquadFieldIVb_, which just implements some of the methods marked here as abstract.

### Attributes

 - `p,q,r` -- squarefree positive integers, corresponds to the integral basis
 -  `p0,q0,r0` -- positive integers, gcd of the other two variables, e.g. _p0 = gcd(q,r)_
 -  `elem_cap` -- integer
 -  `elements` -- list of sets, set _elements[i]_ contains all squares with trace _i_, is counted up to _elem_cap_ and is automatically updated to a needed cap everytime some of the methods uses it

### Constructor

##### `__init__(p,q)`
- automatically computes attributes _r_ and _p0,q0,r0_

### Methods

#### ðŸ”· createField

```python
createField(p,q)
```
Chooses the correct derived class of biquadratic field (depending on the congruence classes of _p,q_) and returns created instance of this field.
Tries to assign values _p,q_ to the corresponding attributes _p,q_ in the biquadratic field if possible but is sometimes forced to change the order due to the integral basis, e.g. _createField(3,7)_ will return _BiquadFieldI(3,21)_.
